# landing-page2
a project from the odin project website
to change it up a bit I picked the topic of cats and adopting them
so if you go to the live preview of the website, you are going to see a website about adopting cats and the cats we have right now (which is not real) and the about us page
in the future I am thinking of adding more pages and functionalities like I did with the about us page
about us page was not part of the original odin projects, it was only the main page
but I wanted to add more pages to the main website!
